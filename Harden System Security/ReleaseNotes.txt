* Added support for verifying the Mandatory ASLR exclusions in the Microsoft Defender category: https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/pull/1053

* Added support for U.S Government cloud environments. You can now sign into the app using a GCC High account and perform all of your security and management tasks in that environment.

* You can now press F5 in any of the Security categories in the app to Refresh the data. It will work as if you pressed the "Verify All" button in that category. If Verify action is already in progress, pressing F5 will cancel it.

* Added a new feature under the "Extras" menu called "EXIF Manager". It is a privacy-focused feature integrated into the Harden System Security app under the Extras section. It allows you to deeply inspect, copy, and securely strip hidden metadata (EXIF, XMP, Comments, etc.) from your photos. It operates directly on the file's data chunks at the lowest level, strictly adhering to the official specs of each data model and photo format, ensuring that your privacy is protected without re-encoding the image or losing any visual quality. You can find the full documentation for this feature on the GitHub repository's wiki: https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/EXIF-Manager
