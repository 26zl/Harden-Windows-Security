* Added a new feature: The **Service Manager**, a feature integrated into the Harden System Security app, is designed to give you comprehensive visibility and granular control over all Windows services. It goes far beyond the capabilities of the native Windows Services utility or 3rd-party tools, offering deep insights, robust filtering, precise metadata extraction, and direct manipulation of service configurations and underlying executable files. It is capable of display all services with any type, something that's not possible through the OS's Service console, Powershell or System Configuration. You can easily see which services are from Microsoft and which ones are 3rd party. Please read more on this GitHub Wiki page: https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Service-Manager

* Added a new feature to the Sidebar that allows you to generate a Battery Report for your device (if it has one). It contains detailed information about your battery usage, wattage and performance.

* When using the CLI mode to export the system report to a file, if you selected a location that doesn't exist, the app now creates the necessary directories and saves the report there instead of showing an error.

* Fixed an error in the CLI mode when applying a preset: https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/issues/1062
