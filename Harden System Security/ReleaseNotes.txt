✅ Added a new entry to the menu called "Extras". It's going to offer additional useful features that are natively built in the Harden System Security app.

🖼️ The first feature under the "Extras" menu is called "Duplicate Photos Finder" and it's been added in this update. It offers all of the tools and controls needed to find duplicate photos among files and folders, review them and delete the duplicates safely. You can undo the deletion too if you accidentally delete something within the app. Helping with organizing your photos and reclaiming storage space. It eliminates the need to install any additional software for this task.

It offers similarity threshold to adjust the detection algorithm's sensitivity and has multiple different criteria that are adjustable for selecting original photos among duplicates.

It doesn't use any 3rd party library or file, works fully offline, and it's very high performance.

Supported Image Formats: jpg, jpeg, png, bmp, gif, tiff, ico, jxr, webp.

The full documentation for this feature is available on the GitHub wiki: https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Duplicate-Photo-Finder
